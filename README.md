This application simulates electrical signal propagation along transmission lines,
demonstrating key phenomena including:

• Signal attenuation  
• Propagation delay  
• Impedance mismatches  
• Reflection and transmission coefficients  
• Standing wave patterns  

Developed with Claude 4.0 Sonnet for educational and engineering analysis purposes.

### ANALYSIS TAB:
1. Adjust impedance values to see reflection effects
2. Modify line parameters to observe propagation changes
3. Change pulse parameters to study different signals
4. Use preset buttons for common scenarios

### ANIMATION TAB:  
1. Set parameters and click "Start Animation"
2. Watch signal propagate along transmission line
3. Observe incident (blue) and reflected (red) waves
4. Total wave (green) shows superposition
5. Use Stop/Reset to control animation

### PRESETS:
• Matched: No reflections (Γ = 0)  
• Open Circuit: Full positive reflection (Γ = 1)  
• Short Circuit: Full negative reflection (Γ = -1)  

### Key Concepts:
• Γ = (ZL - Z0) / (ZL + Z0) - Reflection coefficient  
• Signal speed = c / √εr where c is speed of light  
• Attenuation reduces amplitude with distance
